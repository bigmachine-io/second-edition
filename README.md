# Code for The Imposter's Handbook, Second Edition

I debated whether to organize this code by chapter number or by subject, and I chose the latter because it just makes more sense. Hopefully you can find your way.

## Questions? Issues?

Feel free to leave an issue in the [repository for this code](https://github.com/bigmachine-io/second-edition) or you can also drop by [the discussion board](https://github.com/bigmachine-io/site/discussions) to ask a more general question.

## Running Things

Some of the demos in the binary/bitwise chapters show data in ASCII tables. You can follow along by running `npm install` in the root directory.

Have fun!
